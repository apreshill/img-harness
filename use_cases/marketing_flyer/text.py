"""Marketing exact-text compare (no provider I/O — extract uses openai.responses in schema).

The check asks one question: did every required string appear in the flyer, spelled
and cased exactly? Any text the flyer adds on top of the required copy (a brand name,
a logo wordmark) is reported under ``extra`` for reference but does not fail the check.
Judging whether extra text is a problem is the judge's instruction-following gate, not
this one. Whitespace is normalized before comparing so that OCR spacing quirks do not
cause false misses.
